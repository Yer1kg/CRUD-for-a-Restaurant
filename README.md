Restaurant Crud was created as an example of a web application based on a restaurant card which you can manage.

How does it work:

1.run your vscode and open the folder from Restaurant.
  (Make sure you see the application folder, restaurant folder and the manage.py file along with the Restaurant database).

2.Open a terminal and enter the command "python manage.py runserver".
  Then copy the URL that appears right on this line:
  "Starting development server at URL"

3.Once you view the website you will see that there is a manager where you can add the code and the name of the dish.
  On the right you will see the list that will be added where you can edit or delete any of the dishes.

I added a contact option but it is mostly decorative, don't worry if you see that it doesn't work well.
